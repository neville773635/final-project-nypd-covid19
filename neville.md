Hi, my name is **Neville**, and this is my final project for the course on **Reproducible Data Analysis**.

In this project, I analyzed **two real-world datasets**:

1. **NYPD Shooting Incident Data** from New York City Open Data

2. **Global COVID-19 Data for the year 2022**, using the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 repository

I used **R and R Markdown** to clean, analyze, and visualize the data, and I uploaded everything to **GitHub** to make it reproducible and publicly accessible.

### **ðŸ”« Part 1: NYPD Shooting Incident Report**

For the NYPD Shooting Incident Report, I worked with public data from the NYC Open Data portal. I focused on analyzing patterns and trends in shooting incidents across the five boroughs.

Key insights from my report include:

* The highest number of incidents occurred in the **Bronx and Brooklyn**.

* Most shootings took place between **evening and midnight hours**.

* The majority of victims were male and between the ages of **18 to 35**.

This helped me understand how to filter and group real-world city-level data, and explore patterns based on location, time, and demographics.

I created a summary report in PDF format and included it in my GitHub repository as `new york.pdf`.

### **ðŸ¦  Part 2: COVID-19 Global Trends Report â€“ 2022**

The second part of my project focused on global COVID-19 trends in 2022\. I used the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 time series datasets, including:

* `time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv`

* `time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv`

Using **R Markdown**, I cleaned the data, filtered it to just the year 2022, and generated two global trend plots:

1. A **line chart of confirmed cases** over time

2. A **line chart of deaths** over time

Key findings from the COVID report:

* A major spike in cases occurred in **January 2022**, likely due to the Omicron variant.

* Deaths showed a **declining trend**, even during case surges, possibly due to vaccination and improved treatment.

* I summarized the results in a final PDF report titled `COVID-19 Global Trends Report â€“ 2022.pdf`.

All the R code is included in my `.Rmd` file for reproducibility.

### **âœ… Conclusion**

This final project taught me how to:

* Use R for real-world data analysis

* Create clear visualizations and summaries

* Share my work using **R Markdown** and **GitHub**

You can find all of my files â€” including the NYPD Report, COVID-19 Report, R Markdown code, and raw data â€” in my GitHub repository:
