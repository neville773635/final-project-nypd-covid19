## Introduction

This report provides a summary and analysis of global COVID-19 data during the calendar year 2022. The primary data source is the Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 dataset, which tracks confirmed cases and deaths globally.

The goal is to use reproducible R code to process, clean, analyze, and visualize key trends.

## Libraries and Data Loading

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
{r
# Load datasets
confirmed <- read_csv("data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")
deaths <- read_csv("data/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")
Data Wrangling
{r
# Convert wide format to long format
confirmed_long <- confirmed %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("1"), names_to = "date", values_to = "confirmed") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date))

deaths_long <- deaths %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("1"), names_to = "date", values_to = "deaths") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date))

# Filter for 2022 only
confirmed_2022 <- confirmed_long %>% filter(year(date) == 2022)
deaths_2022 <- deaths_long %>% filter(year(date) == 2022)

# Summarize totals globally by date
daily_confirmed <- confirmed_2022 %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_confirmed = sum(confirmed, na.rm = TRUE))

daily_deaths <- deaths_2022 %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = sum(deaths, na.rm = TRUE))
Confirmed Cases Over Time
{r
Copy

ggplot(daily_confirmed, aes(x = date, y = total_confirmed)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Daily Confirmed COVID-19 Cases – 2022",
       x = "Date", y = "Total Confirmed Cases") +
  theme_minimal()
Deaths Over Time
{r
ggplot(daily_deaths, aes(x = date, y = total_deaths)) +
  geom_line(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(title = "Daily COVID-19 Deaths – 2022",
       x = "Date", y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal()
Conclusion
This report demonstrates how reproducible R code can be used to summarize and visualize important global health data. The trends shown provide insights for continued pandemic monitoring and preparedness.

### ✅ Next Steps:

1. Open **RStudio**.
2. Create a new R Markdown file:  
   `File > New File > R Markdown > Save As covid19_report.Rmd`
3. Paste the entire content above.
4. Save it inside a folder like: `covid19_project/`
   - Also create a subfolder: `covid19_project/data/`
   - Place the two CSV files inside `data/`
5. Click **Knit → Knit to PDF** (or HTML if you prefer)
